    Set up a simple web site on GitHub. Some basic instructions <a href="https://homelesshack.github.io/homelesstemplate/">here</a>
    <p>There are other reasons for having a GitHub account later but for now it is a good way to play around with things and see how they work. I’ve used it for hackathons e.g. <a href="https://homelesshack.github.io/">this one</a> and people who don’t have a lot of money, like a small charity, might not need anything more than this.</p>

<li>
    Learn some basic HTML. Go to: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3schools</a> and do the first few pages (to Attributes).
    <p>Everything on the web uses HTML. You can use it with GitHub Pages, Wordpress and pretty much everything.</p>

<li>
    Go and look at any old website in Google Chrome. Right mouse click on something on the page and choose the "inspect" item. This opens up Developer tools and shows you the HTML (and other stuff) which makes the website.
    Make a list of things you like and copy the bits of HTML from the developer tools window.

<li>
    Create an HTML page (doesn't matter what is in it). Save it as "index.html" and upload it to the github repository you made in step 1.
